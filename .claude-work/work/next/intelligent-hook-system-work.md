# Hook-Driven Intelligent Tool Selection System

*Created: 2025-07-15 21:50*

## Vision

Transform the work tracking system from manual artifact creation to intelligent, context-aware automatic artifact generation. Instead of hooks triggering scripts, hooks should influence Claude's tool selection decisions, making the agent more aware of work context and more likely to create relevant artifacts.

## Core Concept

**Current State**: Manual artifact creation + reactive script hooks
**Future State**: Intelligent tool suggestions + context-aware agent decisions

The system should:
1. **Monitor work context** - Track active work items and their scope
2. **Suggest relevant tools** - Guide Claude toward appropriate MCP tools
3. **Filter by relevance** - Only create artifacts that relate to current work
4. **Build progressively** - Each artifact extends the work narrative

## Architecture Components

### 1. Context-Aware Hook System
Replace script-triggering hooks with intelligent suggestion hooks:

```typescript
interface IntelligentHook {
  trigger: HookTrigger;
  work_context: WorkContext;
  suggested_tools: string[];
  context_prompt: string;
  relevance_filters: RelevanceFilter[];
}
```

### 2. Work Item Context Engine
Track active work items and provide context for tool selection:

```typescript
interface WorkContext {
  active_work_item: Work;
  technical_scope: string[];
  current_phase: 'planning' | 'implementation' | 'testing' | 'review';
  recent_artifacts: Artifact[];
  session_history: ToolUsage[];
}
```

### 3. Tool Relevance Scoring
Evaluate whether tool outputs should become artifacts:

```typescript
interface RelevanceScore {
  contextual_match: number;    // 0-1: matches work item scope
  content_quality: number;     // 0-1: substantial, structured content
  novelty_score: number;       // 0-1: adds new information
  artifact_potential: number;  // 0-1: suitable for artifact creation
}
```

### 4. Intelligent MCP Tools
Enhanced MCP tools that understand work context:

- `create_contextual_artifact()` - Creates artifacts based on work item context
- `suggest_artifact_type()` - Recommends artifact type based on content
- `link_to_active_work()` - Associates artifacts with current work
- `update_work_progress()` - Updates work item metadata automatically

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Hook System Foundation
- [ ] Design hook configuration schema
- [ ] Implement hook trigger detection
- [ ] Create context-aware hook engine
- [ ] Build work item context tracking

### Phase 2: Tool Suggestion Engine
- [ ] Implement tool relevance scoring
- [ ] Create contextual tool suggestions
- [ ] Build content quality assessment
- [ ] Add novelty detection for artifacts

### Phase 3: Enhanced MCP Tools
- [ ] Create context-aware artifact creation tools
- [ ] Implement automatic work item linking
- [ ] Build progressive artifact building
- [ ] Add intelligent artifact type detection

### Phase 4: Agent Integration
- [ ] Integrate hook suggestions with Claude
- [ ] Implement tool selection guidance
- [ ] Create learning feedback loops
- [ ] Build adaptive behavior patterns

## Hook Types and Triggers

### Work Item Lifecycle Hooks
```yaml
work_item_activated:
  suggest_tools: ["create_plan_artifact", "analyze_requirements"]
  context: "Starting work on: ${work_item.title}"
  filters: ["planning_content", "technical_scope"]

work_item_progress:
  suggest_tools: ["create_update_artifact", "update_progress"]
  context: "Making progress on: ${work_item.title}"
  filters: ["progress_updates", "milestone_completion"]
```

### Tool Usage Pattern Hooks
```yaml
substantial_todo_created:
  suggest_tools: ["create_plan_artifact"]
  context: "Substantial planning detected"
  filters: ["structured_content", "implementation_steps"]

code_analysis_completed:
  suggest_tools: ["create_analysis_artifact"]
  context: "Code analysis findings ready"
  filters: ["technical_insights", "decision_points"]
```

### Session Flow Hooks
```yaml
decision_point_detected:
  suggest_tools: ["create_decision_artifact"]
  context: "Important decision made"
  filters: ["architectural_choices", "rationale_provided"]

session_completion:
  suggest_tools: ["create_update_artifact", "update_work_status"]
  context: "Session wrapping up"
  filters: ["progress_summary", "next_steps"]
```

## Relevance Filtering Strategy

### Content-Based Filters
- **Size threshold** - Minimum content length for artifact creation
- **Structure detection** - Formatted content (headers, lists, code blocks)
- **Semantic analysis** - Planning, analysis, or decision language
- **Technical relevance** - Matches work item technical tags

### Context-Based Filters
- **Work item scope** - Relates to current work description
- **Session phase** - Appropriate for current development phase
- **Artifact history** - Doesn't duplicate recent artifacts
- **Progress tracking** - Represents meaningful advancement

### Quality Filters
- **Actionable content** - Contains steps, decisions, or insights
- **Future reference** - Valuable for later work phases
- **Completeness** - Self-contained and understandable
- **Professional quality** - Suitable for project documentation

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
- **Automatic artifact creation** - No manual intervention needed
- **Context-aware filtering** - Only relevant artifacts created
- **Progressive documentation** - Work items build comprehensive narratives
- **Intelligent associations** - Artifacts automatically linked to work

### Long-term Impact
- **Self-documenting projects** - Complete audit trail of work
- **Knowledge preservation** - Decisions and rationale captured
- **Improved continuity** - Easy to resume work across sessions
- **Enhanced collaboration** - Clear work history for team members

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Artifact creation rate** - Automatic vs manual ratio
- **Relevance score** - % of artifacts that are contextually relevant
- **Work item completion** - Artifacts per completed work item
- **Session efficiency** - Time saved on manual documentation

### Qualitative
- **Content quality** - Usefulness of automatically created artifacts
- **Context accuracy** - Artifacts appropriately linked to work
- **Agent behavior** - Natural integration with Claude workflows
- **User satisfaction** - Reduced manual overhead, improved experience

## Risk Mitigation

### Over-Creation Risk
- **Quality thresholds** - Strict filters for artifact creation
- **User override** - Ability to disable/modify suggestions
- **Learning system** - Adapt based on user feedback

### Under-Creation Risk
- **Sensitivity tuning** - Adjustable relevance thresholds
- **Fallback mechanisms** - Manual artifact creation always available
- **Monitoring system** - Track missed artifact opportunities

### Context Accuracy Risk
- **Multi-signal validation** - Multiple relevance indicators
- **User feedback loop** - Correction mechanisms
- **Conservative defaults** - Prefer precision over recall

## Next Steps

1. **Create detailed technical design** - Architecture and implementation specs
2. **Prototype hook system** - Basic context-aware hook engine
3. **Build relevance scoring** - Content quality and context matching
4. **Implement enhanced MCP tools** - Context-aware artifact creation
5. **Integrate with Claude** - Agent guidance and tool suggestions

This system represents a fundamental shift from reactive automation to proactive intelligence, making the work tracking system truly intelligent and self-maintaining.
