  "content": "## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future Work)\n\n### Real-time Updates\n- **WebSocket Integration**: Implement WebSocket connection to the work tracker server for real-time updates. When new work items are created, modified, or completed in other sessions, the UI should automatically reflect these changes without requiring manual refresh.\n- **Live Notifications**: Add a notification system that shows when new findings are discovered, todos are completed, or important state changes occur.\n- **Diff Visualization**: Show what changed between refreshes with visual indicators (new items highlighted, modified items marked).\n\n### Enhanced Search and Filtering\n- **Full-text Search**: Implement comprehensive search across all work item content, not just titles. Search should include content, metadata, findings, and even code references.\n- **Advanced Filters**: Add filtering by date ranges, session IDs, work item types, status, priority, and custom tags.\n- **Saved Searches**: Allow users to save frequently used search queries and filters for quick access.\n- **Search History**: Maintain a history of recent searches for easy re-use.\n\n### Export and Reporting\n- **Multiple Export Formats**: Support exporting work data to JSON, CSV, Markdown, and HTML formats.\n- **Custom Report Generation**: Create themed reports like \"Weekly Progress\", \"Completed Items\", \"Technical Debt\", \"Future Roadmap\".\n- **Selective Export**: Allow users to select specific items or date ranges for export.\n- **Template System**: Provide customizable templates for different report types.\n\n## Phase 4: Integration and Intelligence (Future Work)\n\n### Claude Integration\n- **Direct Claude Queries**: Allow users to query Claude directly from the TUI about specific work items or patterns in their work history.\n- **Context Building**: Use work history to build rich context for Claude conversations, automatically including relevant past work.\n- **Suggestion Engine**: Have Claude analyze work patterns and suggest optimizations, identify blockers, or recommend next steps.\n\n### Smart Analytics\n- **Work Pattern Analysis**: Analyze work patterns over time - productivity trends, common blockers, time spent on different types of work.\n- **Dependency Mapping**: Visualize dependencies between work items, showing which items block others and critical paths.\n- **Progress Predictions**: Based on historical data, predict completion times for similar work items.\n- **Effort Estimation**: Learn from past work to provide better estimates for future similar tasks.\n\n### Workflow Automation\n- **Trigger System**: Set up triggers that automatically create work items based on certain conditions (e.g., failed tests, PR comments).\n- **Bulk Operations**: Support bulk status updates, priority changes, and tagging across multiple items.\n- **Template Work Items**: Create templates for common work patterns that can be instantiated quickly.\n- **Integration Hooks**: Allow external tools to create and update work items via API or CLI commands.\n\n### Collaborative Features\n- **Shared Work Views**: Allow team members to share read-only views of their work state.\n- **Work Item Comments**: Add commenting system for work items to capture additional context and discussions.\n- **Team Analytics**: Aggregate analytics across team members to identify patterns and bottlenecks.\n- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Handle merging work states when multiple team members work on the same project.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\nThese phases were designed to be implemented after the core framework and smart features are stable. Each phase can be broken down into smaller deliverables and implemented incrementally. The key is to maintain the clean architecture established in phases 1-2 while adding these advanced capabilities.",
