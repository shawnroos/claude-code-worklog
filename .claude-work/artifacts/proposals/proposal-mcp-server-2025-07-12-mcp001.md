# MCP Server Integration Proposal

## Overview

This proposal outlines the integration of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to enhance the work tracking system with real-time capabilities and improved context management.

## Key Benefits

1. **Real-time Updates**: Enable live synchronization across multiple sessions
2. **Context Persistence**: Maintain work context across Claude sessions
3. **Enhanced Search**: Powerful query capabilities for historical work
4. **Cross-worktree Awareness**: Better visibility into related work

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Design MCP server architecture
- [ ] Implement core protocol handlers
- [ ] Create client integration layer
- [ ] Add authentication and security
- [ ] Deploy and test integration

## Technical Details

The MCP server will expose the following tools:
- `query_history`: Search historical work items
- `get_historical_context`: Retrieve specific historical items
- `schedule_future_work`: Schedule work for future branches
- `promote_to_active`: Bring historical items to active context
