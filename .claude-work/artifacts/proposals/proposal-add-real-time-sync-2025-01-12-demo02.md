# Proposal: Real-Time Work Tracking Synchronization

## Problem Statement

Currently, when multiple Claude sessions or terminal instances are working on the same project, work state changes are not synchronized in real-time. This leads to:

- Conflicting work assignments
- Duplicate effort on similar tasks  
- Lost context when switching between sessions
- Stale information in UI displays

## Proposed Solution

Implement a lightweight real-time synchronization system that keeps all work tracking instances in sync across terminals and sessions.

## Technical Approach

### Core Components

1. **Local File Watcher**
   - Monitor `.claude-work/` directory for changes
   - Detect markdown file additions, modifications, deletions
   - Trigger sync events when changes occur

2. **WebSocket Server (Optional)**
   - For multi-machine synchronization
   - Broadcast changes to connected clients
   - Handle conflict resolution

3. **Event Bus System**
   - Local event system for single-machine sync
   - File-based message passing between processes
   - Efficient for common single-developer use case

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Local Synchronization
```go
type SyncManager struct {
    watcher   *fsnotify.Watcher
    eventBus  chan SyncEvent
    listeners []SyncListener
}

type SyncEvent struct {
    Type     string // "created", "modified", "deleted"
    ItemID   string
    FilePath string
    Content  *MarkdownWorkItem
}
```

#### Phase 2: Multi-Session Coordination
- Shared lock file for coordinating updates
- Timestamp-based conflict resolution
- Automatic merge for non-conflicting changes

#### Phase 3: Network Synchronization
- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Support for distributed teams
- Encryption for sensitive project data

## Benefits

### Immediate Value
- Real-time UI updates when work items change
- Automatic refresh of stale data
- Better collaboration between multiple sessions

### Long-term Value
- Foundation for team collaboration features
- Improved reliability of work state
- Better user experience with live updates

## Implementation Considerations

### File System Limitations
- Watch for directory changes efficiently
- Handle rapid file updates gracefully
- Avoid infinite update loops

### Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead for file watching
- Debounce rapid changes
- Lazy loading of large work histories

### Backward Compatibility
- Optional feature that can be disabled
- Graceful degradation without sync
- No impact on existing markdown files

## Alternatives Considered

### Database-Based Solution
**Rejected**: Adds complexity and deployment overhead for a primarily local tool

### Polling-Based Updates
**Considered**: Simpler but less efficient and responsive than file watching

### Git-Based Synchronization
**Future Option**: Could leverage git hooks for distributed sync, but requires git workflow

## Success Criteria

- ✅ File changes reflected in UI within 100ms
- ✅ No conflicts during normal single-user operation  
- ✅ Graceful handling of rapid changes
- ✅ <1% CPU overhead for file watching
- ✅ Optional/configurable for users who don't need it

## Next Steps

1. Research file watching libraries (fsnotify vs alternatives)
2. Design event bus architecture
3. Prototype local file sync
4. Test with rapid work item creation/modification
5. Integrate with enhanced UI for live updates

This proposal builds on the solid foundation of the markdown work tracking system to add the real-time capabilities that will make it truly powerful for active development workflows.
