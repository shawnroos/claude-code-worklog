# Centralized Storage Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented a true centralized storage system that stores all work items outside of git repositories, eliminating branch conflicts and merge issues.

## What Was Done

### 1. Implemented External Storage System
- Created storage at `~/.claude/work-data/`
- Project-based organization using git remote URLs for consistent IDs
- Complete separation from git repositories

### 2. Built Project Registration System
- Automatic project detection and registration
- Tracks project metadata (name, path, branch, remote URL)
- Supports multiple projects with easy switching (Ctrl+P in TUI)

### 3. Updated TUI Application
- New `--centralized` flag (default: true)
- Legacy mode available with `--legacy` flag
- Project switcher for managing multiple projects
- Same work view from any branch/worktree

### 4. Comprehensive Migration
- Found and migrated 48 work items (16 unique, 32 duplicates)
- Resolved all duplicates by keeping newer versions
- Cleaned up all old `.claude-work` directories
- Created backups of all migrated data

## Results

### Storage Structure
```
~/.claude/work-data/
├── projects/
│   └── project-index.json
├── work/
│   └── 3f1749c3cf60da7a/     # claude-work-tracker project
│       ├── now/      (5 items)
│       ├── next/     (7 items)
│       ├── later/    (1 item)
│       └── closed/   (6 items)
└── artifacts/
    └── 3f1749c3cf60da7a/
```

### Key Benefits Achieved
- ✅ **No Git Conflicts**: Work items completely outside git
- ✅ **Branch Independent**: Same work across all branches/worktrees
- ✅ **True Single Source**: One location for all projects
- ✅ **Clean Repositories**: No `.claude-work` in repos
- ✅ **Project Isolation**: Each project has its own space
- ✅ **Easy Switching**: Quick project switching in TUI

## Usage

### Run the TUI
```bash
# Default: uses centralized storage
./cw

# Force legacy mode (not recommended)
./cw --legacy
```

### Project Switching
- Press `Ctrl+P` in the TUI to switch between projects
- Projects are automatically registered on first access

### Migration Tools
- Comprehensive migration script: `/scripts/migrate-to-centralized-comprehensive.sh`
- Original migration script: `/scripts/migrate-to-centralized-storage.sh`

## Technical Details

### Project ID Generation
- Uses git remote URL when available (consistent across clones)
- Falls back to hostname + absolute path hash
- Ensures same project maps to same ID

### Data Access
- `CentralizedClient` manages all external storage operations
- `WorkDataProvider` interface for abstraction
- Automatic migration from repository storage on first run

### File Organization
- Work items organized by schedule (now/next/later/closed)
- Artifacts stored separately by type
- Project metadata in JSON registry

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-User Sync**: Optional sharing between team members
2. **Cloud Backup**: Sync to cloud storage providers
3. **Global Search**: Search across all projects at once
4. **Project Templates**: Reusable work templates
5. **Cross-Project Dependencies**: Link work between projects

The centralized storage system is now fully operational and all existing work items have been successfully migrated!
