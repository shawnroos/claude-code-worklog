# Claude Work Tracker TUI

A powerful terminal user interface for managing work items, tasks, and project artifacts with Claude Code.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **4-Tab Interface**: NOW, NEXT, LATER, and CLOSED tabs for work organization

## üìÅ Directory Structure

Work items are organized in markdown files:
```
.claude-work/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ work/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ now/       # Active work
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ next/      # Queued work
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ later/     # Future work
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ closed/    # Completed/canceled
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artifacts/     # Supporting documents
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ updates/       # Work item history
```

## üîß Work Item Format

Work items are markdown files with YAML frontmatter:
```markdown
---
id: work-feature-auth-123456
title: Implement user authentication
schedule: now
status: in_progress
progress_percent: 60
tags: [auth, security, backend]
created_at: 2025-01-18T10:00:00Z
---

# Summary
Implement JWT-based authentication system

## Tasks
- [x] Set up auth middleware
- [x] Create login endpoint
- [ ] Add refresh token logic
- [ ] Write tests
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Migration Tools

### Organize Existing Work
```bash
# Show current distribution
./scripts/migrate-work-items.sh status

# Move completed items to CLOSED
./scripts/migrate-work-items.sh completed

# Move 0% progress items from NOW to NEXT
./scripts/migrate-work-items.sh inactive

# Run all migrations
./scripts/migrate-work-items.sh all
```

## üé® Customization

### Tab Configuration
The interface shows 4 tabs with item counts:
- `‚óè NOW (X)` - Active work in progress
- `‚óã NEXT (Y)` - Ready to start
- `‚äñ LATER (Z)` - Future/backlog items
- `‚úì CLOSED (N)` - Completed/canceled work

### Status Indicators
Work items show status badges:
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Currently being worked on
- `BLOCKED` - Waiting on dependencies
- `COMPLETED` - Successfully finished
- `CANCELED` - Stopped work
- Priority levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

## ü§ñ Intelligent Automation

### Automatic Status Transitions

The work tracker intelligently manages work item lifecycles:

#### Progress-Based Transitions
- **Draft ‚Üí Active**: When progress > 0%
- **Active ‚Üí In Progress**: When progress > 20%
- **In Progress ‚Üí Completed**: When progress reaches 100%

#### Activity-Based Transitions
- **Focus Detection**: High activity triggers priority updates
- **Inactivity Warnings**: Items stale for >48 hours show warnings
- **Decay Prevention**: Stale items suggest schedule changes

#### Git-Driven Automation
- **Branch Tracking**: Items automatically link to Git branches
- **Commit Integration**: Code changes update activity scores
- **Context Synchronization**: Git metadata auto-updates

### Automation Configuration

Access automation settings via `ctrl+a`:
- **Transition Thresholds**: Customize progress and time limits
- **Activity Detection**: Configure focus session parameters
- **Git Integration**: Enable/disable Git workflow tracking
- **Confirmation Rules**: Set which transitions require approval

### User Control

- **NOW Transitions**: Always require explicit user confirmation
- **Manual Overrides**: Action menu provides manual control
- **Disable Options**: Turn off automation per work item
- **Audit Trail**: All transitions logged with timestamps

## üîÑ Auto-Migration

When completing or canceling items:
1. Status updates automatically
2. File moves from current directory to `closed/`
3. CompletedAt timestamp is set
4. Old file is deleted after successful move

This keeps your work directories clean and organized.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Work items not showing
- Ensure `.claude-work` directory exists
- Check file permissions
- Verify markdown files have correct frontmatter

### Search not working
- Search is case-insensitive
- Fuzzy matching allows partial matches
- Try simpler search terms

### Binary not updating
- Check `which cw` to find active binary
- Ensure PATH includes correct directory
- Rebuild with `go build -o cw .`

### Automation not working
- Check automation is enabled in settings (`ctrl+a`)
- Verify work item has required metadata fields
- Look for automation indicators (‚óâ‚óé‚äò) in the UI
- Check Git context is properly detected

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Project-Wide Scanning
The TUI automatically discovers all `.claude-work` directories:
- Scans from current directory up to git root
- Includes all git worktrees
- Shows source location for each item

### Real-Time Sync
File changes are detected automatically:
- New items appear immediately
- Edits refresh the display
- Deletions remove items from view

### Smart Filtering
The CLOSED tab intelligently filters:
- Scans all directories (now/next/later)
- Shows only completed/canceled/archived items
- Maintains original directory context

### Automation Engine
Advanced automation capabilities:
- **Hook System**: Event-driven architecture for extensibility
- **Rule Engine**: Priority-based transition rules
- **Activity Analysis**: Focus session detection and intensity tracking
- **Git Integration**: Branch, commit, and PR workflow awareness
- **Future Vision**: Machine learning, team collaboration, and enterprise features
