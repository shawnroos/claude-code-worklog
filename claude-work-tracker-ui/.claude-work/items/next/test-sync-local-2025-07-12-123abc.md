# Test local real-time sync functionality

## Overview

This is a test work item created in the local .claude-work directory to verify that the real-time sync system is functioning correctly within the UI project directory.

## Test Implementation

The real-time sync system includes:

1. **File Watching (fsnotify)**: Monitors .claude-work directory for file changes
2. **Event Bus**: Processes file system events and converts them to sync events
3. **Terminal Sync**: Broadcasts changes to other terminal instances via file-based messaging
4. **UI Integration**: Updates the UI automatically when work items change

## Success Verification

- [x] SyncManager implementation with fsnotify
- [x] TerminalSync implementation with file-based messaging  
- [x] SyncCoordinator integration layer
- [x] UI integration in main App
- [x] Build compilation successful
- [ ] Runtime testing and verification

## Next Steps

- Test file watching triggers sync events
- Verify terminal synchronization between instances
- Measure performance impact
- Test error handling and edge cases
