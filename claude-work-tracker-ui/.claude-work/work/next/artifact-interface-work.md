# Artifact Interface Implementation

*Last updated: 2025-07-14 16:30*

This work item covers the implementation of artifact browsing, association management, and grouping interface in the TUI. Now that Work items are the primary schedulable containers, we need comprehensive interfaces for managing the supporting artifact ecosystem.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Artifact Browser
- [ ] Design artifact navigation interface
- [ ] Implement artifact type filtering (plan, proposal, analysis, update, decision)
- [ ] Add artifact preview capability
- [ ] Create artifact search functionality

### Phase 2: Association Management
- [ ] Build Work-to-Artifact linking interface
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop association
- [ ] Add association visualization
- [ ] Create association removal workflow

### Phase 3: Group Management
- [ ] Design group creation interface
- [ ] Implement artifact clustering suggestions
- [ ] Add group-to-Work consolidation workflow
- [ ] Create group visualization and management

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add advanced search and filtering
- [ ] Implement artifact embedding preview
- [ ] Create batch operation support
- [ ] Add conflict resolution for associations

## Features Required

- **Artifact Browser**: Navigate through artifact types and content
- **Association Management**: Add/remove artifact references from Work items
- **Group Interface**: Create and manage groups of related artifacts
- **Search & Filter**: Find artifacts by content, tags, or metadata
- **Embedding Support**: Preview and manage artifact embeddings
