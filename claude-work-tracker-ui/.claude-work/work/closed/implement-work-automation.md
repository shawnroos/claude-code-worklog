# Implement heuristic-driven work item automation

## Overview

Implementing a comprehensive automation system for work item transitions based on:
- User behavior patterns and activity
- Git workflow events (branches, commits, PRs)
- Progress milestones
- Time-based heuristics

## Implementation Progress

### âœ… Completed Components

1. **Hook System Foundation** (`internal/hooks/hook_system.go`)
   - Event-driven architecture with typed hooks
   - Concurrent and synchronous execution modes
   - Configurable timeout and error handling
   - Support for status, schedule, progress, activity, and Git events

2. **Transition Rules Engine** (`internal/automation/transition_rules.go`)
   - Rule-based state machine for automatic transitions
   - Priority-based rule evaluation
   - User confirmation for NOW transitions
   - Default rules for common workflows:
     - draft â†’ active (progress > 0)
     - active â†’ in_progress (progress > 20%)
     - in_progress â†’ completed (progress = 100%)
     - stale items â†’ blocked
     - old closed items â†’ archived

3. **Git Context Manager** (`internal/git/context_manager.go`)
   - Caching Git context with TTL
   - Branch and worktree detection
   - Commit tracking and file change monitoring
   - Activity analysis (commit count, ahead/behind)

### âœ… Recently Completed

4. **Enhanced Data Layer** (`internal/data/enhanced_io.go`)
   - Extends MarkdownIO with automation capabilities
   - Integrates hook system for all write operations
   - Auto-generates updates for status and progress changes
   - Handles file moves for schedule transitions

5. **Activity Detection System** (`internal/automation/activity_detector.go`)
   - Tracks work item activity patterns
   - Detects focus sessions and work intensity
   - Suggests transitions based on activity
   - Provides inactivity warnings

6. **Auto-Update Generation**
   - Creates structured update entries for all transitions
   - Links updates to Git commits when available
   - Tracks milestone achievements
   - Maintains complete audit trail

7. **Future Ideas Document**
   - Comprehensive vision for advanced features
   - ML/AI integration possibilities
   - Team collaboration enhancements
   - Enterprise scalability considerations

### âœ… UI Integration Complete

8. **Visual Indicators** (`internal/views/automation_indicators.go`)
   - Unicode-based indicators (no emojis)
   - Shows automation status: â—‰ auto-transitioned, â—Ž pending, âŠ˜ blocked
   - Activity levels: â–°â–°â–° high, â–°â–°â–¡ medium, â–°â–¡â–¡ low
   - Git status: âŽ‡ linked, Â± uncommitted changes
   - Integrated into fancy list view

9. **Configuration Interface** (`internal/views/automation_config_view.go`)
   - Bubble Tea-based configuration UI
   - Editable thresholds and toggles
   - Keyboard navigation with Unicode indicators
   - Save/cancel functionality

10. **Action Menu** (`internal/views/automation_actions.go`)
    - Context-aware automation actions
    - Confirm/reject pending transitions
    - Manual status and schedule changes
    - Clear automation flags
    - Run rules on demand

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **MarkdownIO Integration**
   - Add hook system to WriteWork method
   - Trigger transition evaluation on save
   - Handle file moves for schedule changes

2. **Auto-Update Generation**
   - Create update entries on significant events
   - Link updates to Git commits
   - Structured format with timestamps

3. **Activity Detection**
   - Monitor file save patterns
   - Detect "focus mode" (multiple saves)
   - Correlate with Git activity

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Show automation indicators
   - Display pending transitions
   - Add manual override controls

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Opinionated NOW Transitions**: Only move items to NOW with explicit user action or confirmation
2. **Git-Aware**: Leverage existing Git context in work items
3. **Non-Breaking**: Build on existing foundation without disrupting current functionality
4. **Extensible**: Hook system allows for custom automation rules

## Testing Considerations

- Unit tests for transition rules
- Integration tests for hook execution
- Mock Git commands for testing
- UI tests for automation indicators
