# Test TUI Work Item

*Last updated: 2025-07-14 16:30*

This is a test Work item created to verify that the TUI modification is working correctly. The TUI has been modified to display Work items in the NOW/NEXT/LATER tabs instead of artifacts, representing the new hierarchical structure where Work items are the primary schedulable containers.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- [x] Modified WorkItem struct to use models.Work
- [x] Updated data loading to use GetWorkBySchedule
- [x] Fixed rendering to show Work-specific fields
- [x] Updated both fancy_list_view and tabbed_work_view

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- [x] Added task parsing and management
- [â€¦] Test the enhanced UI functionality
- [ ] Add updates system integration
- [ ] Test artifact embedding

## Features Tested

1. **Display Fields**: Title, status, priority, progress, artifact count
2. **Status Badges**: Different badges for IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED, etc.
3. **Full Post View**: Combined title, description, and content rendering
4. **Navigation**: Tab switching between NOW/NEXT/LATER
5. **Task Management**: Parsing and status tracking
