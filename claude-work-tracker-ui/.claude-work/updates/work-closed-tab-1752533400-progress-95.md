# CLOSED Tab Implementation at 95% - Search & Auto-Migration

## Major Features Added

### üîç Search Functionality
- Press `/` to enter search mode
- Fuzzy text matching across:
  - Title
  - Description  
  - Technical tags
  - Content
- Real-time filtering as you type
- Shows result count: "üîç 'query' (X/Y results)"
- `Enter` to confirm, `Esc` to cancel

### üîÑ Auto-Migration
When you press `c` (complete) or `x` (cancel):
1. Status updates to completed/canceled
2. File automatically moves from `now/` to `closed/`
3. Old file is deleted after successful move
4. CompletedAt timestamp is set

### üìÖ Sorting by Newest First
- CLOSED tab: Sorted by CompletedAt (most recent first)
- Other tabs: Sorted by UpdatedAt
- Makes it easy to see recently completed work

## Implementation Details

### Search Implementation
```go
func fuzzyMatch(query, target string) bool {
    // Substring match
    if strings.Contains(target, query) {
        return true
    }
    // Character sequence match
    // "wtf" matches "work_tracker_file"
}
```

### Auto-Migration
```go
// Calculate old path
oldDir := filepath.Join(workDir, "work", oldSchedule)
oldPath := filepath.Join(oldDir, item.Filename)

// Write to new location
item.Schedule = models.ScheduleClosed
markdownIO.WriteWork(item)

// Delete old file
os.Remove(oldPath)
```

## What's Left (5%)

Only minor tasks remain:
- Validation for status/schedule combinations
- Arrow keys to move items between tabs
- Bulk schedule updates for existing items

## Usage Summary

1. **Search**: Press `/` anywhere to filter items
2. **Complete**: Press `c` in NOW tab (auto-moves to CLOSED)
3. **Cancel**: Press `x` in NOW tab (auto-moves to CLOSED)
4. **Navigate**: Tab/Shift+Tab between tabs
5. **View**: See completed work with colored badges in CLOSED

The CLOSED tab implementation is now feature-complete for daily use!
