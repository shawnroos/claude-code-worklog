# Project-Wide Scanning Implementation Complete

## What Was Implemented

### Core Scanning Methods
1. **GetWorkByScheduleProjectWide()** - Aggregates work items from all `.claude-work` directories
2. **Enhanced GetWorkBySchedule()** - Now uses project-wide scanning by default
3. **Enhanced GetAllArtifacts()** - Aggregates artifacts from all directories
4. **Enhanced GetArtifactsByType()** - Type-filtered artifacts from all directories

### Source Context Tracking
Added to Work model:
```go
SourceDirectory string // Relative path from project root
SourcePath      string // Full path to .claude-work directory
```

### How It Works
```go
// Discovers all .claude-work directories
workDirs := c.Client.scanner.GetAllWorkDirectories()

// Aggregates from each directory
for _, workDirInfo := range workDirs {
    tempIO := NewMarkdownIO(workDirInfo.Path)
    items := tempIO.ListWork(schedule)
    // Add source context
    // Append to results
}
```

## Results

When you run `./cw` from ANY directory, you now see:
- Work items from main project `.claude-work`
- Work items from `worktrees/tasks/.claude-work`
- Work items from any other `.claude-work` directories
- All properly sorted by priority and update time

## Next Steps

While project-wide scanning is working, the centralized storage architecture will provide even better conflict resolution and management. The current implementation is a stepping stone toward that goal.
