# CLOSED Tab Enhanced with Status Badges and Shortcuts

## What's New

### üé® Colored Status Badges
CLOSED tab items now display with beautiful Unicode status indicators:
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (green) - Successfully finished work
- ‚ùå **CANCELED** (red) - Work that was stopped
- üì¶ **ARCHIVED** (gray) - Old completed work

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts
Quick actions from the NOW tab:
- Press **`c`** to mark current item as completed
- Press **`x`** to mark current item as canceled
- Items automatically move to CLOSED with proper status

### üîß Migration Tool
Created `scripts/migrate-work-items.sh` for bulk operations:
```bash
./migrate-work-items.sh status     # Show distribution
./migrate-work-items.sh completed  # Move completed to CLOSED
./migrate-work-items.sh inactive   # Move 0% items to NEXT
./migrate-work-items.sh all        # Run all migrations
```

## Implementation Details

### Status Badge Rendering
```go
// Colored Unicode icons for CLOSED tab
case models.WorkStatusCompleted:
    statusIcon = "‚úÖ "
    coloredStyle = lipgloss.NewStyle().Foreground(lipgloss.Color("42"))
case models.WorkStatusCanceled:
    statusIcon = "‚ùå "
    coloredStyle = lipgloss.NewStyle().Foreground(lipgloss.Color("196"))
```

### Complete/Cancel Methods
```go
func (f *FancyListView) completeWorkItem(item *models.Work) tea.Cmd {
    item.Metadata.Status = models.WorkStatusCompleted
    item.CompletedAt = &time.Now()
    // Write and reload
}
```

## Results

The CLOSED tab now provides:
1. **Visual clarity** with colored status indicators
2. **Quick workflow** with keyboard shortcuts
3. **Bulk management** via migration script
4. **Better UX** with context-aware help text

## Remaining Work (15%)

- Auto-migration on status change
- Sort by completion date
- Quick move between tabs
- Validation for status/schedule combos

The core CLOSED tab functionality is complete and polished!
