# CLOSED Tab Implementation Complete

## What Was Implemented

### UI Changes
- Added CLOSED as the 4th tab after NOW, NEXT, LATER
- Tab navigation now cycles through all 4 tabs
- CLOSED tab displays completed and canceled work items

### Data Model Updates
```go
// Added to models
ScheduleClosed = "closed"
WorkStatusCanceled = "canceled"

// Updated directory mapping
case models.ScheduleClosed:
    return filepath.Join(m.baseDir, "work", "closed")
```

### Directory Structure
```
.claude-work/
├── work/
│   ├── now/       # In-progress only
│   ├── next/      # Ready to start
│   ├── later/     # Future work
│   └── closed/    # Completed/canceled ← NEW
```

## Results

- NOW tab is cleaner - only shows active work
- CLOSED tab provides historical view
- Completed test TUI work item moved to demonstrate
- Clear separation of work states

## Next Steps

While the CLOSED tab is functional, we still need:
1. Automatic status-to-schedule mapping
2. Migration tools for existing items
3. Visual status indicators in CLOSED tab
4. Bulk operations for cleanup

The core functionality is working and ready for use!
