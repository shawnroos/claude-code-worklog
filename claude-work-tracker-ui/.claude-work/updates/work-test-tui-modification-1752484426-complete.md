# TUI Testing Complete

All Phase 2 enhanced features have been successfully implemented and tested:

## Updates System Integration ✅
- Created new `UpdatesView` component with timeline display
- Integrated with `TabbedWorkView` using 'u' key binding
- Supports viewing update history with task completion tracking

## Artifact Embedding ✅
- Verified markdown processor supports `![[artifact-id]]` syntax
- Created sample MCP Server proposal artifact
- Confirmed embedding resolution works in work item display

## Next Steps
The TUI modification is now complete and ready for use. The next work item "Add artifact browsing, association, and grouping interface" can now begin implementation.
